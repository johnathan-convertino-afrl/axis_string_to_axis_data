\section{Usage}

\subsection{Introduction}

\par
This core takes a incoming string, removes the delimiters, terminators, and prefixs.
After this all HEX value characters are converted into there binary values and output
to the ports specified by the prefix.

\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies of the cores.

\begin{itemize}
  \item fusesoc 2.X
  \item iverilog (simulation)
  \item cocotb (simulation)
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/depend_fusesoc_info.tex}

\subsection{In a Project}
\par
Simply use this core between a sink and source AXIS devices. This will convert from input string into an output data one character at a time.
Check the code to see if others will work correctly.

\section{Architecture}
\par
The only module is the axis\_string\_to\_axis\_data module. It is listed below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{axis\_string\_to\_axis\_data } Implement an algorithm to convert input string to data (see core for documentation).
\end{itemize}

\par
The only always process converts the input string to data.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If destination device is ready, clear oout registered output.
\item if we have valid data, insert it into the buffer and increment count.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Counter down to last element? Clear and reset to full length.
    \item if we have the terminator and delimiter, process buffer.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Check for the type of prefix, based on that prefix look at each nibble and offset by its ASCII 0 to F to 0 to 15 binary.
      \item Check for set or clear keywork, if set output data. If clear, remove all data.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Please see \ref{Module Documentation} for more information.

\section{Building}

\par
The AXIS string to AXIS data core is written in Verilog 2001. They should synthesize in any modern FPGA software. The core comes as a fusesoc packaged core and can be
included in any other core. Be sure to make sure you have meet the dependencies listed in the previous section.

\subsection{fusesoc}
\par
Fusesoc is a system for building FPGA software without relying on the internal project management of the tool. Avoiding vendor lock in to Vivado or Quartus.
These cores, when included in a project, can be easily integrated and targets created based upon the end developer needs. The core by itself is not a part of
a system and should be integrated into a fusesoc based system. Simulations are setup to use fusesoc and are a part of its targets.

\subsection{Source Files}

\input{src/fusesoc/files_fusesoc_info.tex}

\subsection{Targets}

\input{src/fusesoc/targets_fusesoc_info.tex}

\subsection{Directory Guide}

\par
Below highlights important folders from the root of the directory.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{docs} Contains all documentation related to this project.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{manual} Contains user manual and github page that are generated from the latex sources.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{src} Contains source files for the core
  \item \textbf{tb} Contains test bench files for iverilog and cocotb
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{cocotb} testbench files
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\newpage

\section{Simulation}
\par
There are a few different simulations that can be run for this core.

\subsection{iverilog}
\par
iverilog is used for simple test benches for quick verification, visually, of the core.

\subsection{cocotb}
\par
Future simulations will use cocotb. This feature is not yet implemented.

\newpage

\section{Module Documentation} \label{Module Documentation}

\par
There is a single async module for this core.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{axis\_string\_to\_axis\_data} AXIS string to AXIS data, convert input string to data.\\
\end{itemize}
The next sections document the module in great detail.
