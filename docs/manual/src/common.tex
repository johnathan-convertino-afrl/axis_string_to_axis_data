\section{Usage}

\subsection{Introduction}

\par
This core takes a incoming string, removes the delimiters, terminators, and prefixs.
After this all HEX value characters are converted into there binary values and output
to the ports specified by the prefix.

\subsection{Dependencies}

\par
The following are the dependencies of the cores.

\begin{itemize}
  \item fusesoc 2.X
  \item iverilog (simulation)
  \item cocotb (simulation)
\end{itemize}

\input{src/fusesoc/depend_fusesoc_info.tex}

\subsection{In a Project}
\par
Simply use this core between a sink and source AXIS devices. This will convert from input string into an output data one character at a time.
Check the code to see if others will work correctly.

\section{Architecture}
\par
The only module is the axis\_string\_to\_axis\_data module. It is listed below.

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{axis\_string\_to\_axis\_data } Implement an algorithm to convert input string to data (see core for documentation).
\end{itemize}

\par
The only always process converts the input string to data.
\begin{enumerate}
\item If destination device is ready, clear oout registered output.
\item if we have valid data, insert it into the buffer and increment count.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Counter down to last element? Clear and reset to full length.
    \item if we have the terminator and delimiter, process buffer.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Check for the type of prefix, based on that prefix look at each nibble and offset by its ASCII 0 to F to 0 to 15 binary.
      \item Check for set or clear keywork, if set output data. If clear, remove all data.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

Please see \ref{Module Documentation} for more information.

\section{Building}

\par
The AXIS string to AXIS data core is written in Verilog 2001. They should synthesize in any modern FPGA software. The core comes as a fusesoc packaged core and can be
included in any other core. Be sure to make sure you have meet the dependencies listed in the previous section.

\subsection{fusesoc}
\par
Fusesoc is a system for building FPGA software without relying on the internal project management of the tool. Avoiding vendor lock in to Vivado or Quartus.
These cores, when included in a project, can be easily integrated and targets created based upon the end developer needs. The core by itself is not a part of
a system and should be integrated into a fusesoc based system. Simulations are setup to use fusesoc and are a part of its targets.

\subsection{Source Files}

\subsection{Targets}

\subsection{Directory Guide}

\par
Below highlights important folders from the root of the directory.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{docs} Contains all documentation related to this project.
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textbf{manual} Contains user manual and github page that are generated from the latex sources.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{src} Contains source files for the core
  \item \textbf{tb} Contains test bench files for iverilog and cocotb
\end{enumerate}

\section{Simulation}
\par
There are a few different simulations that can be run for this core. All currently use iVerilog (icarus) to run. The first is iverilog, which
uses verilog only for the simulations. The other is cocotb. This does a unit test approach to the testing and gives a list of tests that pass
or fail.

\subsection{iverilog}
\par
All simulation targets that do NOT have cocotb in the name use a verilog test bench with verilog stimulus components. These all read in a file
and then write a file that has been processed by the data width converter. Then the input and output file are compared with a MD5 sum to check that they
match. If they do not match then the test has failed. All of these tests provide fst output files for viewing the waveform in the there
target build folder.

\subsection{cocotb}
\par
To use the cocotb tests you must install the following python libraries.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ pip install cocotb
  $ pip install cocotbext-axi
\end{lstlisting}

Then you must use the cocotb sim target. In this case it is sim\_cocotb. This target can be run with various bus and fifo parameters.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ fusesoc run --target=sim_cocotb AFRL:string:axis_data_to_axis_string:1.0.0 --SBUS_WIDTH=4 --USER_WIDTH=8
\end{lstlisting}

The following is an example command to run through various parameters without typing them one by one.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
  $ for i in {1..32}; do sleep 5; fusesoc run --target sim_cocotb AFRL:string:axis_data_to_axis_string:1.0.0 --SBUS_WIDTH=$i ; echo "SLAVE WIDTH:" $i; done
\end{lstlisting}
